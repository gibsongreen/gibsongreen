          <h1>About Me </h1>
          <p>Hello! I like dogs. my name is Gibson Green and I am going into my junior (class of 2021) at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am a Software Engineering Major with a minor in Mathematics. I am a Stellar <br> 
            Research Assistant for Dr. Derek Buzasi at FGCU. Currently, I am researching Stellar bodies recorded in the  <em>2003 GALEX NASA</em> Campaign. I am using the gPhoton Software. I am in the <br>
            Honors College. I have held the position as an Honors College Mentor for the University. I mentored 5 new members of FGCU's Honors College, and helped them acclimate to the University and <br>
            bring them to speed on the expectations of the Honors College. Finally, I am a brother in the Florida Xi Chapter of the Phi Delta Theta Florida Xi chapter at FGCU. <br><br>
            In the world of Software Engineering, I have began my initial steps in my long future as an Engineer. I find myself extremely intrigued and interested and look forward to my education! <br><br>
            In my free time I love watching TedTalks about anything having to do with Futurism, I play Intramural Basketball and follow anything that has to do with basketball, I love playing video <br>
            games that include Fortnite, NBA 2k19, The Elder Scrolls series, etc.

      <td>One of the events that I threw as the Philanthropy Chairman (Fall 2018) of Phi Delta Theta Florida Xi Chapter was
        an electronics raffle to raise money for the ALS Foundation. We raffled off a set of Airpods, an Xbox One X, and an 
        Apple Watch Series 3  We raised $800 dollars that went to ALS research!
